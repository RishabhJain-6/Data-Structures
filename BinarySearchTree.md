(ii) Delete an element x

(iii) Search for an element x in the BST and change its value to y and then place the node with value y at its appropriate position in the BST

(iv) Display the elements of the BST in preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal

(v) Display the elements of the BST in level-by-level traversal

(vi) Display the height of the BST
